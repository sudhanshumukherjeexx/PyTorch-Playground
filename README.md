This notebook introduces the foundational concepts of tensor operations in PyTorch. Tensors are the basic building blocks for deep learning models, and this notebook covers how to initialize, manipulate, and operate on tensors effectively.

### Key Topics Covered:

#### Initializing Tensors:
Learn how to create 1D, 2D, and 3D tensors, as well as how to initialize tensors with specific values or random values.

- 1D, 2D, and 3D tensor creation
- Randomly initialized tensors
- Tensors with specific data types and values

#### Mathematical Operations:
Perform element-wise operations, broadcasting, and basic mathematical functions on tensors.

- Element-wise operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
- Exponentiation and logarithms
- Summation, mean, min, and max operations
- Broadcasting in tensor operations

#### Matrix Operations:
Explore essential matrix operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication (dot product), transposing, reshaping, and slicing.

- Matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- Matrix transpose and inverse
- Reshaping and slicing tensors
- Matrix determinant

#### Tensor Concatenation and Stacking:
Combine tensors using concatenation and stacking operations for flexible data manipulation.

#### Conversion between PyTorch Tensors and NumPy Arrays:
Seamlessly convert between PyTorch tensors and NumPy arrays for compatibility with the broader Python ecosystem.

#### Automatic Differentiation:
A brief introduction to PyTorch's automatic differentiation functionality using `requires_grad` and `backward()`.

#### Installation and Requirements

This repository uses PyTorch. If youâ€™re running it locally, make sure you have PyTorch installed:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
```

Alternatively, you can run the notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), where no setup is required, as PyTorch comes pre-installed.
